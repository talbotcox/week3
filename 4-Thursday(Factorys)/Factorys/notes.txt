Factories
    - Another component in angular
    - Controllers don't share information
        - Big thing factories are used for : 
            * sharing information or methods among controllers
    
    - The data or methods you put inside of a factory are totally arbitrary
    
    - Lazily instantiated by Angular
        - Unless a factory is injected somewhere as a dependency, it doesn't exist
    - Singletons
        - Created only ONCE
        - Injecting a factory into multiple locations means each location gets a reference to the SAME object

var myNum = 5
arr.push(myNum)
myNum += 1

var me = {name : 'rob'}
arr.push(me)
me.name = 'bill'


Filters
    - Typically used in Angular to format values
        - date, currency, number
    - There are a few built in ones that can significantly affect an ngRepeat

    - Filters are normally used inside of angular expressions
    
        -{{candy.price | currency}}
